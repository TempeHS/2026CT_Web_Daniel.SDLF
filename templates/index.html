    <h1>What is Lego?</h1>
    <strong><h2>History of Lego.</h2></strong>
    <p>
      Lego is a series of building blocks developed by Ole Kirk Christiansen in
      1932. It started off as wooden toys that were then eventually manufactured
      into commercially available plastic bricks. Throuought the years, various
      iterations of lego have been released. Techic [1977], Duplo [Literally no
      one cares], and a few more that im not bothered to mention becuase no one
      knows about them.

 <em><h2>Lego is the building blocks of the Universe.</h2></em>
<p>What even is lego? Some people might say it's a philosphy, or some might say it's simply a toy. Whatever view you decide to take, there's no denying that lego can build <em>anything.</em><p>lego has many different types of bricks [over 70 000], and these are compatible and they can be used to make almost anything, from tiny models to recreations of real cars.</p>

 <em><h2>The price of lego (a lot)</h2></em>
